# FlyGWAS
In my postdoc for one project, I ran GWAS on a cohort of ~200 lines of Drosophila (fruit flies) for many metabolism and aging traits.
This is old example code from that project. It can use a few different statistical tests, hunting for association signal.
We used random permutation of real data (to break the linkage with phenotype) to get a noise floor for the association p-values.
